# verify-declared-bump.sh -- ticket 43 (ticket 18 Answer 5), nist's half.
# The declared bump lives in a reviewed file (bump.yaml); this asserts that
# the file and the tree agree, offline, with no tag and no network:
#   1. the ladder itself, on fixtures (--selfcheck);
#   2. the REAL declaration against the REAL tree (--tree) -- the same
#      question .github/workflows/cut-release.yml asks before it tags.
#
# CORRECTED 2026-09-08 (eco-system ticket 103): --tree derives the next tag from
# the declaration and refuses a tag that is not that bump of the newest release,
# reads the predecessor -- file name and bytes -- AT ITS TAG, and tells "no tags
# in this clone" apart from "never released" by asking origin: the one call that
# is not offline, reached only when this checkout holds no release tag at all.
# This clone holds them. The gate no longer exits 3 on an empty tag list (the
# hub's talk/verify-manifest.txt declares no could-not-look for this row, so
# that shrug graded FAIL anyway); the exit-3 branch below is kept for a future
# --tree with a real reason not to look, and says so if it is ever taken.
# Exit 0 observed true, 3 could-not-look (nothing takes it today), non-zero
# observed false.
